Fuge provides a generation and execution environment for microservice development on Node.js. It aims to help developers working on microservice systems in several ways:

- By providing a service execution environment
- By reducing the friction between processes and containers during development

Full documentation is available at [fuge.io](http://fuge.io/).

## Install
To install, use npm to install globally.

```
npm install -g fuge
```

## Demo

## Fuge commands

Fuge commands have the following format:

`fuge <command> <options>`

The current supported commands are:

* `fuge build` - build a system by executing the RUN commands in each services Dockerfile
* `fuge pull <compose-file>` - update a system by attempting a git pull against each service
* `fuge clone <Github repo>` - clone a Github repo, supports all valid repo name formats
* `fuge generate <Github repo>` - alias for `fuge clone`. Will be deprecated.
* `fuge run <compose-file>` - run a system
* `fuge preview <compose-file>` - preview a run command for a system
* `fuge shell <compose-file>` - start an interactive shell for a system
* `fuge version` - display the fuge version
* `fuge help` - show help

## Fuge shell
Fuge provides a simple shell to manage microservice execution. To start the shell run:

```
fuge shell ./fuge/compose-dev.yml
```

The fuge shell supports the following commands:

* **help** - display a list of supported commands
* **ps** - list status of managed processes and containers
* **proxy** - list proxy and port forwarding status
* **info [process name]** - show information on a specific process
* **stop [process]** - stop a process and any associated watcher
* **stop all** - stop all processes and watchers
* **start [process]** - start a process
* **start all** - start all stopped processes
* **debug [process]** - start a process in debug mode and launch node-debug (experimental)
* **profile [process]** - start a process with [0x](http://npm.im/0x), when the process is stopped a flamegraph will be generated in the services folder.
* **watch [process] | all** - turn on watching for a process or for all processes
* **unwatch [process] | all** - turn off watching for a process or for all processes
* **tail [process] | all** - tail output for a process or for all processes
* **untail [process] | all** - end tail output for a specific processes or for all processes
* **grep 'search string' [process]** - searches a process' log or all processes' logs
* **exit** - terminate all managed processes and exit


## Mixed Containers and Processes

A Fuge system has the following key files:

* A docker-compose yaml file that serves as the main configuration reference for the system
* A **fuge-config.json** file - contains fuge specific settings and overrides not supported by docker-compose

In fact, a Fuge configuration file can be run entirely using docker-compose. If you have Docker installed you can try this out by running:

```
cd ./fuge_system_folder
docker-compose up
```

Docker will build a set of containers and start them up for you using the docker-compose yaml file.


## Adding Infrastructure
Let's say that we want one of our services to connect a redis server. We could go ahead and install redis to our development system. Another approach however is to use Docker. If you have Docker installed then try the following:

Edit the system yaml file (let's name it **compose-dev.yml**) and add the following:

```
redis:
  image: redis
  ports:
    - 6379:6379
```

Ensure that the redis container is on your system by running:

```
docker pull redis
```

Start the system up in the fuge shell again by running:

```
fuge shell ./fuge/compose-dev.yml
```

Starting fuge will now start the redis container as well as your micro-services.

## Fuge config
A sample Fuge config file:

```
module.exports = {

  // run docker containers. If false containers with image attribute will not be run
  runDocker: true,

  // proxy settings - one of the options: docker | process | all | none
  proxy: 'none',

  // if true tail running process to the shell by default
  tail: false,

  // if true monitor running processes for changes by default
  monitor: true,

  // exclude these patterns from the monitor
  exclude: /node_modules|\.git|\.log/mgi,

  // override section. Allows the default build, run and debug commands
  // to be overriden on a service by service basis. These commands are
  // normally generated by inspecting the Dockerfile for a service
  overrides: {
    service1: { build: 'sh build.sh' }
  }
}
```

## Proxy
In addition to running Docker containers, Fuge will proxy connections to the Docker virtual machine on a mac and windows environment. Running the proxy command will show you how fuge is proxying connections to the Docker containers running as part of your system
